----

### This repository features a data analysis project for a company's logistics sector using Power BI. The dataset was cleaned and processed, resulting in the creation of an interactive dashboard for data visualization and interpretation. Please note that the language of the implementation is in the authors' native language (Brazilian Portuguese).

## Introduction
  This project involves a detailed data analysis of a company's logistics sector using Power BI. The data was extracted from a spreadsheet, cleaned, and transformed using Power Query, then an interactive dashboard was created to facilitate data visualization and interpretation. The project is part of the Power BI 2024 minicourse offered by the [Hashtag Treinamentos](https://www.youtube.com/@HashtagTreinamentos) channel and is available in the following playlist: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxjKFMYkZ9Ocwz4qywOc5qYLi6apNZlCw].
## Dashboard Creation from Transformed Data
  
Fig. 1 displays the interactive dashboard created using Power BI.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <em>Fig. 1. Interactive Dashboard
       </em>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Spreadsheet Transformation Using Power Query
  As seen in Fig. 2, the spreadsheet was transformed using the Power Query tool so that the dashboard could later be designed as desired.

  </tr>

## Credits
This project was based on the Power BI 2024 minicourse from the [Hashtag Treinamentos channel](https://www.youtube.com/@HashtagTreinamentos/featured), but it was carried out individually by me while attending the lessons. The minicourse is available in the following playlist: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxjKFMYkZ9Ocwz4qywOc5qYLi6apNZlCw].
